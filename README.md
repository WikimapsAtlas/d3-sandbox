#### V.1.0
This repository was the former d3js sandbox / demobox of the Wikimaps Atlas project. 
We here use geojson or topojson data from the Wikimaps Atlas API, beautifying them using D3js.
When one visualisation type is mature, we integrage the code into our map generator system, 
loop all over the world, so all areas are displayed elegantly with this style.

#### V.2.0
We now recommand dev-cartographers to [create][1] and demo **stand alone gists**, with relevant css & js.
Your gists create your own porfolio publicly visible via Mike Bostock's [Bl.ocks.org][2] service.

You can then submit us your link on our issue page. 
We welcome it, will add your gist url and description to the list of D3js cartographic gists.
The most interesting visualisation for encyclopedic usages will be integrated
into Wikipedia's Wikimaps project to map all countries of the world with it :)
